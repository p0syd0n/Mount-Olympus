# Mount Olympus
## Welcome to Mount Olympus, the platform of choice for privacy enthusiasts.
Mount Olympus is a secure and quantum resistant forum/messaging/selling/storage platform. If your government or other malicious agencies who hate privacy come after you, you want your information to be safe. Constantly relying on random, scattered services is frankly annoying. Mount Olympus is the solution. Offered is a quantum-proof platform that has it all - direct messaging, group chats, a forum, cloud storage (soon), and a vendor section (soon).

### Forum
Share information about various topics in the forum. The forum is accessible to everyone with an account.

### Direct Messages
Message colleagues and other people with quick and real-time direct messaging functionality. Your messages are end-to-end encrypted with RSA, so no one with access to the server or database can read them. With a few tweaks, you can set your messages to not be saved. All encryption happens in the browser, and private keys are never sent to the server. Don't believe me? Check the code!!

### Group Chats
Group chats are end-to-end encrypted with AES256 keys. When you create a group, you are given the key. From that point on, it is your responsibility to keep track of it. To decrypt messages in the group chat, the room key is necessary. When you want to join a room, other clients in the room will send the room key to you (unless the room is locked). In transit, the room key is encrypted with your public key. I cannot read it while it is being sent to you. If there is no one online and you do not have the key, you can't read the messages.

### Future
In the future: Accounts will be paid through BTC. Cloud storage will be offered. Special, vendor accounts will exist. An Escrow system will be implemented.

### Security
All data is stored in a secure database. The database has row-level AES 256 encryption with a key provided at server startup. Every single piece of data stored will be encrypted.
